The programs subdirectory contains all of the sample programs used in
this text, arranged into subdirectories by chapter, as follows:

     02-Learning-by-Example 03-Problem-Solving 04-Statement-Forms 05-
     Functions 06-Algorithms 07-Graphics 08-Random-Numbers 09-Strings
     10-Modular-Development 11-Arrays 12-Sorting 13-Pointers 14-
     Strings-Revisited 15-Text-Files 16-Records 17-Looking-Ahead

In addition to the source files, each chapter directory also contains a
Unix-style Makefile that creates each of the applications.  On systems
that don't support a make facility, the Makefile cannot be used directly
but nonetheless illustrates how the individual source files are combined
to form complete programs.  The Makefile is written to assume the
existence of a command script called gccx, which is described in the
README file for the unix-xwindows implementation.

To simplify the process of copying the source programs, the programs
directory also contains an archive subdirectory, which includes the
following three files:

programs.shar   This file is a text archive of the entire set of
(Unix systems)  programs created using a Unix utility called shar.

                TO RECREATE THE programs DIRECTORY ON YOUR UNIX SYSTEM:

                1.  Connect your FTP application to the archive
                    subdirectory.

                2.  Retrieve the programs.shar file.

                3.  Unpack the programs.shar archive by typing the
                    following Unix command:

                         sh programs.shar

                    The effect of this command is to create a directory
                    named programs containing the entire directory tree.

programs.hqx    This file is a compressed archive of the entire set of
(Macintosh)     programs created using a combination of two utilities
                for the Macintosh: CompactPro and BinHex4.

                TO RECREATE THE programs DIRECTORY ON YOUR MACINTOSH:

                1.  Connect your FTP application to the archive
                    subdirectory.

                2.  If your version of FTP allows you to do so, set the
                    transfer type to BinHex4 and retrieve the file; then
                    skip ahead to step 4.

                3.  If you cannot find a way to retrieve BinHex4 files
                    directly, retrieve the programs.hqx archive in ASCII
                    mode, and then run it through the public-domain
                    BinHex4 conversion utility, which you will have to
                    obtain for your Macintosh.

                4.  At this point, you should have an application file
                    on your Macintosh called programs.sea, which is the
                    output of the BinHex4 conversion.  Run the
                    programs.sea application by double-clicking its
                    icon.

                5.  When the file dialog for the CompactPro utility
                    appears, select a folder into which you would like
                    to install the programs tree and click the Extract
                    button.

programs.exe    This file is a compressed archive of the entire set of
(IBM PC)        programs created using an archive utility called LHA.
                Because the IBM PC does not support file names longer
                than eight characters, the names of the directories are
                formed simply by taking the letters CH and following it
                with a two-digit chapter number.  For example, the
                programs for Chapter 7 are in the subdirectory CH07.

                TO RECREATE THE programs DIRECTORY ON YOUR PC:

                1.  Connect your FTP application to the archive
                    subdirectory.

                2.  Retrieve the programs.exe file in binary mode.

                3.  Unpack the archive file by typing the following DOS
                    command:

                         programs
